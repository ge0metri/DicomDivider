# DicomDivider
Small application made at [Aarhus University at Department of Forensic Medicine](https://forensic.au.dk/) to take folders of mixed up DICOM files and divide them in to folders denpendend on FOV, kernel and series number.

Apparently many scanners export files in a jumble, this application was made to sort such mixed up files into neat folders.
